## **Beginner API Ideas**

These projects focus on understanding how RESTful APIs work, handling requests, and managing data.

1. **Simple To-Do List API**

    - CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
    - Use a database like SQLite or MongoDB
    - Authentication (optional)

2. **Basic User Authentication API**

    - JWT-based authentication
    - User registration and login system
    - Password hashing using bcrypt

3. **Notes Management API**

    - Users can create, edit, and delete notes
    - Secure notes with authentication
    - Store data in a database

4. **Weather API Wrapper**

    - Fetch data from an external weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)
    - Process and return the necessary weather details
    - Cache data to reduce external API calls

5. **URL Shortener API**
    - Convert long URLs into short ones
    - Redirect users to the original URL
    - Track the number of visits

## **Intermediate API Ideas**

These involve integrating third-party services, handling complex queries, and optimizing performance.

6. **E-Commerce API**

    - Manage products, categories, and orders
    - Implement user authentication and admin roles
    - Payment gateway integration (Stripe, PayPal)

7. **Blog or CMS API**

    - Create, edit, and delete posts
    - Comments and likes system
    - User roles (admin, author, reader)

8. **Real-time Chat API**

    - WebSocket-based chat system
    - Authentication for users
    - Store chat history

9. **Expense Tracker API**

    - Manage user expenses and income
    - Generate reports and statistics
    - Set budget goals and alerts

10. **File Upload and Storage API**

-   Upload and retrieve files
-   Secure access to files
-   Integrate with cloud storage (AWS S3, Firebase)

## **Advanced API Ideas**

These require complex logic, scalability, and security considerations.

11. **AI-Powered Recommendation System API**

-   Analyze user behavior
-   Suggest products, articles, or music
-   Use machine learning for recommendations

12. **Banking or FinTech API**

-   Manage user accounts and transactions
-   Implement two-factor authentication (2FA)
-   Encrypt sensitive financial data

13. **Real-time Stock Market API**

-   Fetch live stock prices from third-party sources
-   Implement WebSockets for real-time updates
-   Provide insights and predictions

14. **Multi-Tenant SaaS API**

-   Build a SaaS product with multiple tenants
-   Each tenant has isolated data
-   Implement a subscription model

15. **Blockchain API (Ethereum, Solana, or Bitcoin)**

-   Create smart contracts
-   Handle cryptocurrency transactions
-   Generate and verify digital signatures

## **Extra Challenges for Experts**

-   Implement **GraphQL** instead of REST for some APIs
-   Use **Event-Driven Architecture** with Kafka or RabbitMQ
-   Build **Microservices Architecture** for a scalable system
-   Secure APIs with **OAuth 2.0** or **API Gateway**
-   Deploy APIs using **Docker & Kubernetes**
