## **ðŸ“Œ 9. Role-Based Access Control**

If you implement **RBAC** (Role-Based Access Control), you can restrict access to certain routes based on user roles.

For example, only **admins** should be able to delete tasks. You can modify `middleware/rbac.js` to enforce this.

## **âœ… Ready to Use!**

You can now use **Postman** or **Thunder Client** in VS Code to test your API. If you want to integrate this API into a frontend, you can use React, Angular, or any other framework.

Would you like me to help with the frontend part too? ðŸš€
