Yes, the **Task Management API** I shared with you is relatively basic, focusing on the core functionality for managing tasks and projects. Here's an overview of what makes it basic and what could be added for more advanced features:

### **Basic Features:**

1. **Authentication**: Uses JWT for user authentication.
2. **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks.
3. **Task Attributes**: Tasks include title, description, priority, and deadline.
4. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Basic role assignment (e.g., "admin") but can be extended.
5. **Task Assignment**: Allows assigning tasks to users.
6. **Filtering**: Basic filtering by status, priority, and deadline.

### **What Could Be Added for an Advanced API:**

1. **User Management**:

    - Support for multiple user roles (admin, manager, member) with fine-grained access control.
    - Features like user profile management (e.g., changing passwords, updating profiles).

2. **Advanced Task Features**:
    - Sub-tasks or task dependencies (tasks that depend on other tasks).
    - Recurring tasks (tasks that repeat periodically).
    - Attachments or file uploads related to tasks.
    - Commenting system on tasks for collaboration.
3. **Project Management**:

    - Ability to create and manage projects, with tasks grouped under them.
    - Progress tracking for tasks and projects.

4. **Email Notifications**:

    - Email notifications for task assignments, deadlines, or changes.

5. **Real-Time Features**:

    - WebSocket integration for real-time updates (e.g., task status changes, new assignments).

6. **Database Relationships**:

    - More complex relationships like project-team assignments, task tags, and status history tracking.

7. **API Rate Limiting**:

    - Implement rate limiting for better API security and performance.

8. **Logging & Monitoring**:

    - Add logging for important actions (task updates, user logins).
    - Integrate monitoring tools like **Winston** or **Morgan**.

9. **Data Validation & Error Handling**:

    - Robust error handling with consistent error messages.
    - Validate inputs to avoid issues like SQL injection or invalid data.

10. **Unit & Integration Testing**:
    - Use tools like **Jest** or **Mocha** for testing the API endpoints.

If you'd like, I can guide you through implementing any of these advanced features. Would you like to go deeper into any particular area? ðŸ˜Š
